Steps taken to reproduce GSI (rubias) and Parentage (CKMRsim) analysis

Take Filtered SNP data. My work used microhaplotype data, and I would recommend it for assay design.

Calculate summary stats in the SNP_summary_table.Rmd module

Select loci to simulate with, using the pick_panel_loci.Rmd 
	For me it typically turns into a running script with each panel getting it's own block which is great for method documentation.
	This could be made into a function, but potential variation in selection methods has stopped me from doing this as of now

NOTE: You will need to create the global variable with your selected loci "loci_for_panel" in the pick_panel_loci.Rmd script and pass this 
	to your simulations, so you are properly indexing the loci you wish to test.

GSI Simulations (100% sims in rubias)	
Format vcf to rubias format in the top half of the GSI_100perCent_Sims.Rmd
		run simulations in bottom half

Parentage Simulations (CKMrsim)
Format vcf to CKMrsim format in top half
	run simulations in bottom half
